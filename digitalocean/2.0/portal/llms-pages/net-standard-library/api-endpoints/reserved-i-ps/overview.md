# Overview

Source: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hashimaawan/sdk-portal/main/digitalocean/2.0/portal/#/net-standard-library/x-redirect/JTI0aCUyRl9fYXBpX3JlZmVyZW5jZSUyRlJlc2VydmVkJTI1MjBJUHMlMkZPdmVydmlldw

As of 16 June 2022, we have renamed the [Floating IP](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#tag/Floating-IPs)
product to Reserved IPs. The Reserved IP product's endpoints function the exact
same way as Floating IPs. The only difference is the name change throughout the
URLs and fields. For example, the `floating_ips` field is now the `reserved_ips` field.
The Floating IP endpoints will remain active until fall 2023 before being
permanently deprecated.

With the exception of the [Projects API](https://docs.digitalocean.com/reference/api/api-reference/#tag/Projects),
we will reflect this change as an additional field in the responses across the API
where the `floating_ip` field is used. For example, the Droplet metadata response
will contain the field `reserved_ips` in addition to the `floating_ips` field.
Floating IPs retrieved using the Projects API will retain the original name.

DigitalOcean Reserved IPs are publicly-accessible static IP addresses that can be
mapped to one of your Droplets. They can be used to create highly available
setups or other configurations requiring movable addresses.

Reserved IPs are bound to a specific region.
