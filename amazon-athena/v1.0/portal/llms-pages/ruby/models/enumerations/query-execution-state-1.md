<p>The state of query execution. <code>QUEUED</code> indicates that the query has been submitted to the service, and Athena will execute the query as soon as resources are available. <code>RUNNING</code> indicates that the query is in execution phase. <code>SUCCEEDED</code> indicates that the query completed without errors. <code>FAILED</code> indicates that the query experienced an error and did not complete processing. <code>CANCELLED</code> indicates that a user input interrupted query execution.</p> <note> <p>Athena automatically retries your queries in cases of certain transient errors. As a result, you may see the query state transition from <code>RUNNING</code> or <code>FAILED</code> to <code>QUEUED</code>. </p> </note>
