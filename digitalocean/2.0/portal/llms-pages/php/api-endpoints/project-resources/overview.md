Project Resources are resources that can be grouped into your projects.
You can group resources (like Droplets, Spaces, load balancers, domains,
and floating IPs) in ways that align with the applications you host on
DigitalOcean.

### Supported Resource Types Examples

Projects resources are identified by uniform resource names or URNs. A
valid URN has the following format: `do:resource_type:resource_id`. The
following resource types are supported:

Resource Type      | Example URN
-------------------|------------
App Platform App   | `do:app:be5aab85-851b-4cab-b2ed-98d5a63ba4e8`
Database           | `do:dbaas:83c7a55f-0d84-4760-9245-aba076ec2fb2`
Domain             | `do:domain:example.com`
Droplet            | `do:droplet:4126873`
Floating IP        | `do:floatingip:192.168.99.100`
Kubernetes Cluster | `do:kubernetes:bd5f5959-5e1e-4205-a714-a914373942af`
Load Balancer      | `do:loadbalancer:39052d89-8dd4-4d49-8d5a-3c3b6b365b5b`
Space              | `do:space:my-website-assets`
Volume             | `do:volume:6fc4c277-ea5c-448a-93cd-dd496cfef71f`

### Resource Status Codes

When assigning and retrieving resources in projects, a `status` attribute
is returned that indicates if a resource was successfully retrieved or
assigned. The status codes can be one of the following:

Status Code        | Explanation
-------------------|------------
`ok`               | There was no problem retrieving or assigning a resource.
`not_found`        | The resource was not found.
`assigned`         | The resource was successfully assigned.
`already_assigned` | The resource was already assigned.
`service_down`     | There was a problem retrieving or assigning a resource. Please try again.


# Get singleton instance

The singleton instance of the `ProjectResourcesApi` class can be accessed from the API Client.

```
$projectResourcesApi = $client->getProjectResourcesApi();
```
