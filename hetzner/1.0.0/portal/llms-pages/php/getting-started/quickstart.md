# Introduction

This is the official API documentation for the Public Hetzner Cloud.

## Introduction

The Hetzner Cloud API operates over HTTPS and uses JSON as its data format. The API is a RESTful API and utilizes HTTP methods and HTTP status codes to specify requests and responses.

As an alternative to working directly with our API you may also consider to use:

* Our CLI program [hcloud](https://github.com/hetznercloud/cli)
* Our [library for Go](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-go)
* Our [library for Python](https://github.com/hetznercloud/hcloud-python)

Also you can find a [list of libraries, tools, and integrations on GitHub](https://github.com/hetznercloud/awesome-hcloud).

If you are developing integrations based on our API and your product is Open Source you may be eligible for a free one time €50 (excl. VAT) credit on your account. Please contact us via the the support page on your Cloud Console and let us know the following:

* The type of integration you would like to develop
* Link to the GitHub repo you will use for the Project
* Link to some other Open Source work you have already done (if you have done so)

## Getting Started

To get started using the API you first need an API token. Sign in into the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) choose a Project, go to `Security` → `API Tokens`, and generate a new token. Make sure to copy the token because it won’t be shown to you again. A token is bound to a Project, to interact with the API of another Project you have to create a new token inside the Project. Let’s say your new token is `jEheVytlAoFl7F8MqUQ7jAo2hOXASztX`.

You’re now ready to do your first request against the API. To get a list of all Servers in your Project, issue the example request on the right side using [curl](https://curl.haxx.se/).

Make sure to replace the token in the example command with the token you have just created. Since your Project probably does not contain any Servers yet, the example response will look like the response on the right side. We will almost always provide a resource root like `servers` inside the example response. A response can also contain a `meta` object with information like [Pagination](https://docs.hetzner.cloud/#overview-pagination).

**Example Request**

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer jEheVytlAoFl7F8MqUQ7jAo2hOXASztX" \
    https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/servers
```

**Example Response**

```json
{
    "servers": [],
    "meta": {
        "pagination": {
            "page": 1,
            "per_page": 25,
            "previous_page": null,
            "next_page": null,
            "last_page": 1,
            "total_entries": 0
        }
    }
}
```

## Authentication

All requests to the Hetzner Cloud API must be authenticated via a API token. Include your secret API token in every request you send to the API with the `Authorization` HTTP header.

To create a new API token for your Project, switch into the [Hetzner Cloud Console](https://console.hetzner.cloud/) choose a Project, go to `Security` → `API Tokens`, and generate a new token.

**Example Authorization header**

```html
Authorization: Bearer LRK9DAWQ1ZAEFSrCNEEzLCUwhYX1U3g7wMg4dTlkkDC96fyDuyJ39nVbVjCKSDfj
```

## Errors

Errors are indicated by HTTP status codes. Further, the response of the request which generated the error contains an error code, an error message, and, optionally, error details. The schema of the error details object depends on the error code.

The error response contains the following keys:

| Keys      | Meaning                                                               |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `code`    | Short string indicating the type of error (machine-parsable)          |
| `message` | Textual description on what has gone wrong                            |
| `details` | An object providing for details on the error (schema depends on code) |

**Example response**

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "invalid_input",
    "message": "invalid input in field 'broken_field': is too long",
    "details": {
      "fields": [
        {
          "name": "broken_field",
          "messages": ["is too long"]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

          "name": "project_limit"
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Labels

Labels are `key/value` pairs that can be attached to all resources.

Valid label keys have two segments: an optional prefix and name, separated by a slash (`/`). The name segment is required and must be a string of 63 characters or less, beginning and ending with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics between. The prefix is optional. If specified, the prefix must be a DNS subdomain: a series of DNS labels separated by dots (`.`), not longer than 253 characters in total, followed by a slash (`/`).

Valid label values must be a string of 63 characters or less and must be empty or begin and end with an alphanumeric character (`[a-z0-9A-Z]`) with dashes (`-`), underscores (`_`), dots (`.`), and alphanumerics between.

The `hetzner.cloud/` prefix is reserved and cannot be used.

**Example Labels**

```json
{
  "labels": {
    "environment":"development",
    "service":"backend",
    "example.com/my":"label",
    "just-a-key":""
  }
}
```

## Label Selector

For resources with labels, you can filter resources by their labels using the label selector query language.

| Expression           | Meaning                                                             |
|----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `k==v` / `k=v`       | Value of key `k` does equal value `v`                               |
| `k!=v`               | Value of key `k` does not equal value `v`                           |
| `k`                  | Key `k` is present                                                  |
| `!k`                 | Key `k` is not present                                              |
| `k in (v1,v2,v3)`    | Value of key `k` is `v1`, `v2`, or `v3`                             |
| `k notin (v1,v2,v3)` | Value of key `k` is neither `v1`, nor `v2`, nor `v3`                |
| `k1==v,!k2`          | Value of key `k1` is `v` and key `k2` is not present                |

### Examples

* Returns all resources that have a `env=production` label and that don't have a `type=database` label:
  
  `env=production,type!=database`

* Returns all resources that have a `env=testing` or `env=staging` label:
  
  `env in (testing,staging)`

* Returns all resources that don't have a `type` label:
  
  `!type`

## Pagination

Responses which return multiple items support pagination. If they do support pagination, it can be controlled with following query string parameters:

* A `page` parameter specifies the page to fetch. The number of the first page is 1.
* A `per_page` parameter specifies the number of items returned per page. The default value is 25, the maximum value is 50 except otherwise specified in the documentation.

Responses contain a `Link` header with pagination information.

Additionally, if the response body is JSON and the root object is an object, that object has a `pagination` object inside the `meta` object with pagination information:

**Example Pagination**

```json
{
    "servers": [...],
    "meta": {
        "pagination": {
            "page": 2,
            "per_page": 25,
            "previous_page": 1,
            "next_page": 3,
            "last_page": 4,
            "total_entries": 100
        }
    }
}
```

The keys `previous_page`, `next_page`, `last_page`, and `total_entries` may be `null` when on the first page, last page, or when the total number of entries is unknown.

**Example Pagination Link header**

```bash
Link: <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=2&per_page=5>; rel="prev",
      <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=4&per_page=5>; rel="next",
      <https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?page=6&per_page=5>; rel="last"
```

Line breaks have been added for display purposes only and responses may only contain some of the above `rel` values.

## Rate Limiting

All requests, whether they are authenticated or not, are subject to rate limiting. If you have reached your limit, your requests will be handled with a `429 Too Many Requests` error. Burst requests are allowed. Responses contain serveral headers which provide information about your current rate limit status.

* The `RateLimit-Limit` header contains the total number of requests you can perform per hour.
* The `RateLimit-Remaining` header contains the number of requests remaining in the current rate limit time frame.
* The `RateLimit-Reset` header contains a UNIX timestamp of the point in time when your rate limit will have recovered and you will have the full number of requests available again.

The default limit is 3600 requests per hour and per Project. The number of remaining requests increases gradually. For example, when your limit is 3600 requests per hour, the number of remaining requests will increase by 1 every second.

## Server Metadata

Your Server can discover metadata about itself by doing a HTTP request to specific URLs. The following data is available:

| Data              | Format | Contents                                                     |
|-------------------|--------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| hostname          | text   | Name of the Server as set in the api                         |
| instance-id       | number | ID of the server                                             |
| public-ipv4       | text   | Primary public IPv4 address                                  |
| private-networks  | yaml   | Details about the private networks the Server is attached to |
| availability-zone | text   | Name of the availability zone that Server runs in            |
| region            | text   | Network zone, e.g. eu-central                                |

**Example: Summary**

```bash
$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata
```

```yaml

```

```json
- ip: 10.0.0.2
  alias_ips: [10.0.0.3, 10.0.0.4]
  interface_num: 1
  mac_address: 86:00:00:2a:7d:e0
  network_id: 1234
  network_name: nw-test1

```

**Example: Region**

```bash
$ curl http://169.254.169.254/hetzner/v1/metadata/region
eu-central
```

## Sorting

Some responses which return multiple items support sorting. If they do support sorting the documentation states which fields can be used for sorting. You specify sorting with the `sort` query string parameter. You can sort by multiple fields. You can set the sort direction by appending `:asc` or `:desc` to the field name. By default, ascending sorting is used.

**Example: Sorting**

```bash
https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status
https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:asc
https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:desc
https://api.hetzner.cloud/v1/actions?sort=status:asc&sort=command:desc
```


# Building

The generated code has dependencies over external libraries like UniRest and JsonMapper. JsonMapper requires docblock annotations like `@var`, `@maps`, and `@factory` to map JSON responses with our class definitions. Hence the docblocks in generated code cannot be disabled by deactivating the PHP configurations like `opcache.save_comments`. These dependencies are defined in the `composer.json` file that comes with the SDK. To resolve these dependencies, we use the Composer package manager which requires PHP greater than or equal to 7.2 installed in your system. Visit [https://getcomposer.org/download/](https://getcomposer.org/download/) to download the installer file for Composer and run it in your system. Open command prompt and type `composer --version`. This should display the current version of the Composer installed if the installation was successful.

* Using command line, navigate to the directory containing the generated files (including `composer.json`) for the SDK.
* Run the command `composer install`. This should install all the required dependencies and create the `vendor` directory in your project directory.

![Building SDK - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?workspaceFolder=HetznerCloudApi&step=installDependencies)

## Configuring CURL Certificate Path in php.ini

:information_source: **Note** This is for Windows users only.

CURL used to include a list of accepted CAs, but no longer bundles ANY CA certs. So by default it will reject all SSL certificates as unverifiable. You will have to get your CA's cert and point curl at it. The steps are as follows:

1. Download the certificate bundle (.pem file) from [https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html](https://curl.haxx.se/docs/caextract.html) on to your system.
2. Add curl.cainfo = "PATH_TO/cacert.pem" to your php.ini file located in your php installation. “PATH_TO” must be an absolute path containing the .pem file.

```
[curl]; A default value for the CURLOPT_CAINFO option. This is required to be an
; absolute path.
curl.cainfo = PATH_TO/cacert.pem
```


# Installation

The following section explains how to use the HetznerCloudApiLib library in a new project.

## 1. Open Project in an IDE

Open an IDE for PHP like PhpStorm. The basic workflow presented here is also applicable if you prefer using a different editor or IDE.

![Open project in PHPStorm - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?workspaceFolder=HetznerCloudApi&step=openIDE)

Click on `Open` in PhpStorm to browse to your generated SDK directory and then click `OK`.

![Open project in PHPStorm - Step 2](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?workspaceFolder=HetznerCloudApi&step=openProject0)

## 2. Add a new Test Project

Create a new directory by right clicking on the solution name as shown below:

![Add a new project in PHPStorm - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?workspaceFolder=HetznerCloudApi&step=createDirectory)

Name the directory as "test".

![Add a new project in PHPStorm - Step 2](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?workspaceFolder=HetznerCloudApi&step=nameDirectory)

Add a PHP file to this project.

![Add a new project in PHPStorm - Step 3](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?workspaceFolder=HetznerCloudApi&step=createFile)

Name it "testSDK".

![Add a new project in PHPStorm - Step 4](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?workspaceFolder=HetznerCloudApi&step=nameFile)

Depending on your project setup, you might need to include composer's autoloader in your PHP code to enable auto loading of classes.

```php
require_once "vendor/autoload.php";
```

It is important that the path inside require_once correctly points to the file `autoload.php` inside the vendor directory created during dependency installations.

![Add a new project in PHPStorm - Step 5](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?workspaceFolder=HetznerCloudApi&step=projectFiles)

After this you can add code to initialize the client library and acquire the instance of a Api class. Sample code to initialize the client library and use the Api methods is given in the subsequent sections.

## 3. Run the Test Project

To run your project you must set the Interpreter for your project. Interpreter is the PHP engine installed on your computer.

Open `Settings` from `File` menu.

![Run Test Project - Step 1](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?workspaceFolder=HetznerCloudApi&step=openSettings)

Select `PHP` from within `Languages & Frameworks`.

![Run Test Project - Step 2](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?workspaceFolder=HetznerCloudApi&step=setInterpreter0)

Browse for Interpreters near the `Interpreter` option and choose your interpreter.

![Run Test Project - Step 3](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?workspaceFolder=HetznerCloudApi&step=setInterpreter1)

Once the interpreter is selected, click `OK`.

![Run Test Project - Step 4](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?workspaceFolder=HetznerCloudApi&step=setInterpreter2)

To run your project, right click on your PHP file inside your Test project and click on `Run`.

![Run Test Project - Step 5](https://apidocs.io/illustration/php?workspaceFolder=HetznerCloudApi&step=runProject)
